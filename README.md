# Real-estate-prices

# Real Estate Tycoon Project
# Real Estate

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for a data science regression project aimed at building a machine learning model that can predict real-estate house property prices.

# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts real-estate house prices. To achieve this, we utilize the power of data science techniques, data analysis, and feature engineering along with the Scikit-learn library for building the regression model.

# Environment and Libraries
The code in the notebooks was executed using Python 2.7 and relies on the following Python libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Please note that using Python 2.7 might be outdated, and it is recommended to adapt the code to Python 3.x for better compatibility and access to the latest features and libraries.

# Dataset and Data-Dictionary
The project's dataset contains various features related to real-estate properties, such as size, location, amenities, and more. A comprehensive description of each feature can be found in the Data-Dictionary file.
